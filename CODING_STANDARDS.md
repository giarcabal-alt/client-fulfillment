# Coding Standards

A lightweight standards doc for small-to-medium projects. Goal: code that's easy to maintain, easy to hand off, and doesn't over-engineer for a problem that doesn't exist yet.

## 1. Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── components/     # UI pieces, one responsibility each
│   ├── lib/             # shared logic, helpers, API clients
│   ├── pages/ (or app/) # routes
│   └── styles/
├── public/
├── docs/
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md
│   └── FEATURES/         # one short doc per feature (optional, see §5)
├── .env.example
├── README.md
└── CODING_STANDARDS.md   # this file
```

Rule of thumb: if you can't say what a folder is for in one sentence, it's organized wrong.

---

## 2. Naming Conventions

| What | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files (components) | PascalCase | `UserCard.jsx` |
| Files (utils/config) | kebab-case | `date-utils.js` |
| Variables/functions | camelCase | `getUserProfile()` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRIES` |
| Components | PascalCase | `<UserCard />` |
| CSS classes | kebab-case | `.user-card` |

Be consistent even when you disagree with the convention — consistency beats personal preference.

## 3. Code Organization Rules

- **One responsibility per function.** If a function needs "and" to describe what it does, split it.
- **Files under ~200 lines** as a soft ceiling. Past that, look for a natural split.
- **No premature abstraction.** Don't build a plugin system, config layer, or generic utility for a single use case. Solve today's problem; refactor when a second use case actually appears.
- **Separate concerns**: UI rendering, business logic, and data access shouldn't live in the same function, even in a small app. They can live in the same *file* if the file is short — just keep the logic separable.
- **Centralize config**: all environment variables and constants pulled from one place (e.g. `lib/config.js`), never hardcoded inline.
- **Never commit secrets.** `.env` in `.gitignore`, `.env.example` checked in with placeholder values.

---

## 4. Comments & Readability

- Comment **why**, not **what**. `// retry 3x because the upstream API rate-limits aggressively` is useful. `// loop through users` is not.
- Prefer a clear variable/function name over a comment explaining an unclear one.
- Leave a short comment on anything non-obvious: a workaround, a magic number, an ordering dependency.

---

## 5. Documentation — After Every Feature

Every feature/PR gets **two** things updated, no more:

1. **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — one entry, 3–5 lines:
   ```
   ## [Unreleased]
   ### Added
   - Short description of what changed and why it matters to a user.
     Any breaking change or migration note goes here.
   ```
2. **`README.md`** — only if the feature changes *how someone uses or runs the project* (new env var, new command, new setup step). If it's purely internal, skip the README.

Optional (use if the feature is complex enough to need it): a one-page doc in `docs/FEATURES/feature-name.md` covering what it does, how to use it, and any gotchas — max ~150 words. Don't create one of these for trivial features; that's noise, not documentation.

**Do not** write documentation that just restates the code. Documentation answers "what does this do for the user/dev" and "why does it exist," not "here is a list of every function."

---

## 6. Version Control

- Commit messages follow a lightweight Conventional Commits style:
  - `feat: add user profile page`
  - `fix: correct date formatting on invoice`
  - `docs: update README setup steps`
  - `refactor: split UserCard into smaller components`
- One logical change per commit. Avoid "fix stuff" commits covering five unrelated things.
- Branch per feature/fix; short-lived branches, merge back promptly.

---

## 7. Dependencies

- Before adding a new package, ask: can this be done in ~20 lines of plain code? If yes, don't add the dependency.
- Any new dependency added should have a one-line justification in the commit message or PR description.
- Periodically check for unused dependencies (`depcheck` or similar) — don't let `package.json` accumulate dead weight.

---

## 8. Error Handling & Security Basics

- Validate input at the boundary (form submission, API route) — don't trust client data.
- Fail loudly in development (clear error messages), fail gracefully in production (no stack traces shown to users).
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, full user records) even in dev.
- Auth/permission checks belong on the server side, never only in the UI.

---

## 9. Testing (right-sized)

Small projects don't need full test suites to be "doing it right." Prioritize:
- A manual test checklist per feature (documented in the PR or feature doc): what to click, what should happen.
- Automated tests only for logic that's easy to get subtly wrong (calculations, data transforms, auth rules) — not for simple UI rendering.
- If you don't have automated tests yet, that's fine — just be honest about it in the docs rather than pretending coverage exists.

---

## 10. When in Doubt

Pick the boring, obvious solution over the clever one. Small projects are maintained by future-you (or someone else) reading the code cold — optimize for that person's ability to understand it in five minutes, not for elegance.
