# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Server-side CRUD for roles: `src/lib/talent-acquisition/roles-actions.ts`
  (`createRole`, `updateRoleTitle`, `updateRoleJobDescription`,
  `updateRoleStatus`, `deleteRole`) — every action derives the user via
  `getUser()` server-side (never a client-passed id), relies on RLS org
  scoping for authorization (no external side effect to separately check),
  and fails securely with generic messages while logging real errors
  server-side. `/talent-acquisition/roles` lists roles with an inline-editable
  title, job description, and status (save-on-blur / save-on-select, each
  field its own Server Action call), a status badge, a live candidate count
  per role, delete (blocked with a friendly message if candidates still
  reference the role), and a form to add a new role.
- Found and fixed a real bug while building this: the tables from the Prompt 3
  migration had RLS but no table-level Postgres `GRANT`s, so every request —
  even with the service-role key — failed with "permission denied", before
  RLS was ever evaluated. Added
  `supabase/migrations/20260914060451_fix_grants_and_roles_delete_policy.sql`
  (grants + default privileges for `authenticated`/`service_role`, deliberately
  none for `anon`) alongside the roles `delete` RLS policy this task needed.
  Neither this nor the Prompt 3 migration has been applied yet — see
  `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Database schema as a Supabase migration
  (`supabase/migrations/20260914053122_initial_schema.sql`), not applied —
  `profiles`, `roles`, `candidates`, `candidate_history`, `candidate_drafts`,
  and `org_settings` per `BUILD_BRIEF.md` §4, with RLS enabled on every table
  and org-scoped select/insert/update policies (derived through the parent
  `candidates` row for the two tables without their own `org_id` column). Adds
  a `security definer` `current_org_id()` helper so the `profiles` table's own
  policy can check org membership without recursive RLS. Seeds the single
  hardcoded org's `org_settings` row.
- Invite-only Supabase email/password auth: a `/login` page (outside the shell)
  backed by a `login` Server Action, and a `(shell)` route group whose layout
  checks `supabase.auth.getUser()` server-side and redirects unauthenticated
  requests to `/login` — no public sign-up route. The shell sidebar shows a
  text-based stand-in for the UpScaleSupport wordmark alongside "Client
  Fulfillment App", with "Talent Acquisition Desk" active and "Onboarding" /
  "Kickoff" as disabled "Coming soon" items. Added a sign-out Server Action.
  Root `/` now lives inside the shell and redirects to
  `/talent-acquisition/board` (placeholder page for now), replacing the
  Prompt 1 demo page. Verified locally against a real Supabase project and
  redeployed to Vercel with the real project's env vars.
- Scaffolded the Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) project, Tailwind CSS v4 with a
  CSS-first `@theme` config carrying the UpScaleSupport brand tokens (colors,
  Bricolage Grotesque + Inter, no dark mode), and shadcn/ui. Wired up
  `@supabase/ssr` (cookie-based client/server/proxy helpers, `getUser()` only —
  never `getSession()`) plus a server-only service-role client. Added
  `.env.example` and deployed a minimal build to Vercel to confirm the pipeline
  works end to end.
